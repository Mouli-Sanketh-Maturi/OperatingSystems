This project is an example implementation of building an Operating System from scratch.

**Things that work:**
 - Printing a Screen.
 - Reading from Keyboard (even with Backspace).
 - Read a sector from disk.
 - Own Interrupt.
 - printString, readString, and readSector interrupt calls.

**Compiling**

```
./compileOS.sh
```

This will handle the compiling and assembling into a disc image.
